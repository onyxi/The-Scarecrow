# The-Scarecrow

The majority of code developed by me can be found in the ‘game.lua’ file. This is mostly hand-written code, but using adapted methods here and there - especially where the physics/collisions/object-management gets complicated. 

Aside from this, the project makes use of some external tools to manage custom fonts, graphics/sprite sheets and scene transitions.

All media assets were created with Serif DrawPlus (images) and making use of few royalty free sounds for audio.
